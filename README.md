# Lendal Case Study
> Project by Beng Cheong and Geraldine Bengsch
> This project uses EDA to identify common types of risks found in consumer finance companies lending loans:
> - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
> - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## General Information

- **General information:** A loan describes money that is being lend to an individual or an organisation. The loan recipient receives the money with the implication that the money will be paid back over time. When lend through a financial institution, the recipient usually will be liable to pay interest on the amount of money received.

- **Background:** There are many reasons why a person may need to lend money. A common reason is the consolidation of debt, that is, combining debt from various creditors into a single amount. Other common reasons include large purchases, such as a car or property purchase, or starting a business.

- **Business problem:**
Banks can earn money through lending money out to their customers and the compensation of a certain interest rate. However, this assumes that the debtors will indeed repay their loan in full. A borrower may find themselves unable to make payments, meaning that the loan will default. As a result, the bank looses not only the principal amount, but also the interest on the money. Banks need to make a decision on who they lend money to. This usually occurs based on data from previous loan recipients.

- **Dataset:** The dataset consists of 111 columns and 39717 entries. Not all columns contain data, with a total number of 2263364 missing entries.



## Conclusions
- Using a loan to pay off another loan in form of debt consolidation is the largest factor in why people default on their loan
